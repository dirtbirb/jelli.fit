## Local Development

This is a guide on getting Jelli Fit working locally for development purposes. You should first follow this if you're thinking of making a [pull request](#pull-requests).

Note: if you'd like to get Jelli Fit running because you want to have your own instance, please instead follow the [self-hosting](https://github.com/dirtbirb/jelli.fit/wiki/Self%E2%80%90hosting) guide.

### Software

Jelli Fit is written using Rust (for the API) and Next.js (for the frontend). Before you begin, you'll need to make sure you have the required software installed:

| Software | Installation instructions |
| --- | --- |
| git | You'll need git to clone the repository. You likely already have it if you're on MacOS, otherwise see the [git site](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git). |
| node | I recommend using `nvm` or `fnm` to manage multiple node versions, but you can also install directly from the [node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/download). |
| yarn | Node comes with `npm`, which you can use to run `npm install --global yarn` to install yarn. |
| rust | You can install rust by following the directions on the [rust website](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install). |

### Setup

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `cargo run` in the `api` folder to build and start the API.
3. Run `yarn` in `frontend` folder to install dependencies, then `yarn dev` to start the dev server.

By default, the API will start at http://localhost:3000, and the frontend will be available at http://localhost:1234.

#### Code Documentation

For code-specific documentation, please see the README files in the repo.

### Browser Extension

The Jelli Fit browser extension is currently an iFrame that points to `/create` on the frontend. To test, edit the `popup.html` file's iframe src to be `http://localhost:1234/create`, then view that in your browser.

Note that you can't just visit the url directly, as it will redirect to the full create form if not running within an iFrame.

## Pull Requests
